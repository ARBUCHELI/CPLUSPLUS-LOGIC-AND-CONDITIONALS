# CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
------------------------

* Introduction to Conditional Statements
----------------------------------------
We make decisions all the time in our life based on different conditions. Are you going to drink tea or coffee? Study history or biology? Buy a new shirt or save your money?

We can program computers to make decisions based on different conditions. We can specify to the computer the order in which it should execute certain instructions, or that it should only 
execute certain instructions in specific cases. That means that depending on the conditions, the instructions that our program executes can change.

The order that computer programs execute a set of instructions is known as control flow. We can use different control structures to alter the flow of our program. Control structures let 
us handle different situations that might arise and make our programs more flexible. In C#, these type of statements are known as conditional or selection statements.

Boolean logic and conditional statements go hand in hand. A computer will determine if a condition is true or false and execute a set of instructions accordingly. Make sure that you’re 
comfortable with Boolean values, comparison operators, and logical operators!

We’ll look at a couple of different structures that use Boolean logic to control the flow of our programs, including:

	. If statements

	. If…Else… statements

	. Else if statements

	. Switch statements

	. Ternary Operators
